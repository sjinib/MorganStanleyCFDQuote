1. Maintain two orders on each side
2. When there is source data update and no order execution, modify the price of the order
3. When there is execution, cancel the order and resubmit the order using new data

Other situations:
1. Order canceled - resubmit order
2. Order rejected - resubmit order

Work flow:
1. Check open orders
	if no order, place order
	(update source data should automatically update order if needed)
	if order status has filled - resubmit order
	
2. Monitor update source data to update order accordingly
3. Monitor execution to update order accordingly

Next step:
OpenOrder lock for OrderManager
Position lock for PositionManager

Need to find a way to request open order at start and wait until all open orders are returned and verify -> determine what to do next

Questions:
1. Price calculation based on position offset
2. STATIC_OFFSET
3. PositionAdjustment

Questions:
1. Do you want to add maximum quantity precaution?
